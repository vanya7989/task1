Summary of Code for House Price Prediction
------------------------------------------
>Load the data: The code loads the house price dataset from a CSV file.

>Prepare the data: The code prepares the data by converting categorical features to numerical features and handling missing values.

>Split the data into training and test sets: The code splits the data into training and test sets using the train_test_split() function from scikit-learn.

>Create the linear regression model: The code creates a linear regression model using the LinearRegression() class from scikit-learn.

>Train the model: The code trains the linear regression model on the training set.

>Evaluate the model: The code evaluates the linear regression model on the test set using the mean_squared_error() function from scikit-learn.

>Make predictions: The code uses the trained linear regression model to make predictions on new data.
